# Document Title

A little paragraph here.

## Subtitle Goes Here

This is a paragraph including a `md-code span` and also a `backtick phrase` and a `mono span`.

## Formatting

Sometimes it is useful to have **bold text** and *italic text*, for example.

## Tables

Tables are supported by ContentStack, and so should be supported by doc2md.
